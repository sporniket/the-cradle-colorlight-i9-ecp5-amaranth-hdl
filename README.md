# The Cradle for MuseLab's Colorlight i9 

* The [Colorlight i9 by Muse Lab](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005001686186007.html) is an FPGA based board, powered by a [Lattice ECP5](https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5) FPGA.
* [Amaranth HDL, previously nMigen](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth) is a python library to generate an abstract syntax tree of an hardware design, in order to configure a supported FPGA .

**The Cradle for MuseLab's Colorlight i9** aims at providing an access to the commodities of the board (HDMI output, EPROM, RAM,...). Then a guest project can glue those commodities with an actual design, like e.g. interfacing a vintage CPU and emulate the behavior of a vintage computer.

> Status : 'vaporware' ; lots of thinking, no -or so few- actual code.
