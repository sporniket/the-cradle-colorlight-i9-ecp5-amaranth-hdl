## 1. What is **The Cradle for MuseLab's Colorlight i9 by Sporniket**, and when to use it ?

* The [Colorlight i9 by Muse Lab](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003832457085.html) is an FPGA based board, powered by a [Lattice ECP5](https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/ECP5) FPGA.
* [Amaranth HDL, previously nMigen](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth) is a python library to generate an abstract syntax tree of an hardware design, in order to configure a supported FPGA .

**The Cradle for MuseLab's Colorlight i9 by Sporniket** aims at providing an access to the commodities of the board (HDMI output, EPROM, RAM,...). Then a guest project can glue those commodities with an actual design, like e.g. interfacing a vintage CPU and emulate the behavior of a vintage computer.

### What's new in v0.1.0

* First release : the onboard led blinks every second, and when branched to an HDMIÂ screen, a solid-colored screen blinks between a blue-ish and a yellow-ish color.

## 2. What should you know before using **The Cradle for MuseLab's Colorlight i9 by Sporniket** ?

**The Cradle for MuseLab's Colorlight i9 by Sporniket** requires a set of tools to build and deploy to an actual Colorlight i9 board :

* **Python 3.10 and pip** ; then the script `repip` will invoke pip to install supplemental modules.
* [Yosys (mandatory components and boolector)](https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), [PrjTrellis](https://github.com/YosysHQ/prjtrellis), [nextpnr-ecp5](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) and [openFPGALoader](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader).

I wrote [a little log of what I did to get my workstation up and running](https://medium.com/@sporniket.studio/setting-up-the-computer-ubuntu-linux-my-journey-with-the-amaranth-hdl-fc789c766670).

Other python dependencies are pulled when launching the automated tests with `retest` or uploading the generated gateware using `redeploy` :
* [amaranth-stuff](https://github.com/sporniket/amaranth-stuff), notably contains the TMDS encoder.
  * [amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth).
  * [amaranth-boards](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth-boards).
